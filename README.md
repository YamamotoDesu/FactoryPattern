The Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) pattern separates objects into three types: models, views and view-models.

Models hold onto application data. They are usually structs or simple classes.  
View-models convert models into a format that views can use.  
Views display visual elements and controls on screen. They are usually subclasses of UIView.  

## Code Example(MVVM)
```swift
